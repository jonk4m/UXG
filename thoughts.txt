Thoughts 


Why not send PDW's over SCPI?
it is slow as hell. The UXG is the throttle on this one, I checked.
for example, if I send it a 45KB file it takes our program 0.5 seconds to send it over, but it takes the uxg 2min to get to the bottom of 
the queue of scpi's and be done. 

Why not send the PDW's over ftp?
we would have to make massive csv files and 
even though the transfer is really fast, then telling the uxg to convert it into pdw takes too long 
for example, if I send it a 48MB file it takes ftp 2seconds to send it over, but it takes the uxg 1min to convert it. 

currently my program takes a yatg, converts it into scpi commands and sends them to the uxg, then it tells the uxg to convert that csv file into a pdw file


what if we took a YATG file, converted it into a streamable pdw file, then used ftp to send it to the uxg. This makes it so the uxg doesn't have to convert it. Still doesn't get
rid of the fact that we have to create another massive file (although half as big as the original csv).

Best solution seems to be somehow stream to a file. Basically same scheme as my current scpi method but with a faster transfer method than scpi 







ok so if I want to make a Streamable file, I need to create a file that follows the Streaming file format definition: http://rfmw.em.keysight.com/wireless/helpfiles/n519xa/Content/User's%20Guide/Streaming%20Mode%20File%20Format%20Definition.htm
as well as each pdw following the pdw definition : http://rfmw.em.keysight.com/wireless/helpfiles/n519xa/Content/User's%20Guide/Streaming%20Mode%20PDW%20Definitions.htm
then I'd dump it on the UXG using FTP and then I can immediately play from it 


instead of scpi or ftp to get PDW's on the uxg is there a faster way of dumping data on there?
scpi just takes forever, creating a csv or txt file out the the yatg file to then do ftp and tell it to convert will take up too much memory (think if they handed you a 1GB YATG
file you'd have to convert it into a csv that's at least a GB to then do ftp and finally tell the uxg to convert it) 

setup a timer to see if our program is what's slow for sending scpi or if it's the UXG.
If it's ours:
find out why 
how big is the scpi buffer on the UXG?
If it's the UXG: (it was the UXG)
Can we send it all as one scpi?
start investigating using ftp
