include in the manual that the user must create the fpcs prior to creating the signals or else they won't be able to select the pattern that each signal corresponds to 
include in manual that you don't have to type hz or degrees everytime 
include in manual why you can't just download an fpcs file from the web ftp and then it will say the header is wrong. (it's because you have to import from my application so the application can rewrite the header)
include in manual why you decided not to include functionality for batch files - user can simply create a blank csv using the program, then type in what they want manually (biggest hassle would be just converting their pattern to hex and making sure they all trailing not leading zeros) 
include in manual what broken out code is specifically for ftp
INCLUDE IN PRESENTATION THE ISSUE YOU RAN INTO WITH THE TRAILING ZEROS FOR THE HEX CONVERSION OF THE BITPATTERN. SINCE THE UXG READS THE PATTERN IN TRANSMISSION ORDER, A PATTERN OF 110 NEEDS TO HAVE A TRAILING ZERO (1100) FOR THE HEX CONVERSION, NOT A LEADING ZERO (0110) SINCE IT STARTS READING FROM THE FRONT OF THE PATTERN NOT THE BACK. AKA THAT TRAILING ZERO WILL BE IGNORED
include in manual that files in download folder get deleted if you try to download a file with the same name from the uxg
sepperate the manual into the user's manual and the programmer's manual 
include in manual that when you press "ok" on the new table table you can't immediately go to select a local table and have it will show up since the file is still open
include in manual that user should not try to connect to uxg while it is starting up, otherwise a power cycle will be required for the GUI to be able to reach it. reason is unknown
include in manual that YATG files do not belong in the uploads folder since we will create a file with the identical name in that folder (and then delete it) 
include in manual that user should NOT put files in the uploads or downloads folders since these are for files created or retrieved by the program only and can delete these files unexpectantly.
include in manual that a list of pdw files for batch playing should not include the ".csv" in the names

This is done by typing in a name for the table and selecting the "Specify Table Name" radio button then clicking the "OK" button, or by using the default table name. The directory for where the file is stored can be selected using the "Change Table Directory" button PRIOR to pressing the "OK" button that creates the file. Once the "OK" button is pressed, the user may begin to edit the table by selecting one of the options in the "Table Visualization" groupbox.
