include in the manual that the user must create the fpcs prior to creating the signals or else they won't be able to select the pattern that each signal corresponds to 


implement "delete table from UXG" button 
Add barker codes as an option
add batch text file
create "connect to uxg" tab
decide on what to do about signal creator tab
go through todo's in the code
add functionailty to edit previous patterns in a table
meet with Jeremy and Dave
Make table visualization 
add "clear" button for pattern editing so the current pattern is cleared
add "clear all entries" button for a table probably under the table visualizer
figure out why uniform noise doesn't just happen at the one specified freq
double check that freq entries are relative not absolute
make the state of the first pattern be "off"
fix the hex conversion so it doesn't chop off bits? 
increment default table name
add in code that lets the user know the max phase value allowed is 180
add in code that tells the user if they've reached the 512 max patterns
figure out how to get the comment in increment correctly if you are opening an existing table
add a "delete all pdw files on uxg" and "delete all Freq/Phase Tables on UXG" buttons to the connect to UXG tab
figure out how to retrieve and parse diagnostic info from the UXG (prolly using status register) to know how it's doing as well as knowing when a file is finished playing for the rotor to know
allow user to select a file from the UXG to edit, then add functionality so when they upload it first deletes the old one of that name
Add these SCPI commands to happen after the ftp process uploads a file:
  //This step imports the csv table values into the current table but does not create a file from those values
  MEMory:IMPort:ASCii:FPCSetup TestTable.csv
  //store and export both use the SCPI command EXPort. The way it knows to export as a CSV or FPCS and put it in the correct file location accordingly is you have to specify in the file name either .csv or .fpcs
  //This step takes the data of the current table and exports it into a FPCS file on the UXG so it can be used later
  MEMory:EXPort:ASCii:FPCSetup TestTable.fpcs
  //this step sets the current table to the exported FPCS file we just made
  SOURce:PULM:STReam:FPCSetup:SELect TestTable.fpcs
Allow user to choose from list of hostnames or IP's in the "connect to UXG" tab for choosing the current UXG
