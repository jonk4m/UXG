The absolute best way to do it is to download the "Keysight Instrument Control Bundle Download" and install each of the programs from there starting with the Command Suite.
Then download the Command Expert by clicking the install and lastly the Benchview

^^^^ Don't do that, when I tried it didn't install the files to the correct directories. Instead do it the hard way:

Install Keysight Connection Expert 2020

After opening it, connect to your UXG by hitting the "+ADD" button. Then click the tab "Command Expert".
When prompted, hit the link to download it, and on that webpage click the tab that says "trials & Licenses".
Click the download button, and don't worry it's not a trial or license it's free to use.
